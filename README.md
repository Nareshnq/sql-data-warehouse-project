# 📊 SQL Data Warehouse Project

Hi there, and welcome to my **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project**!  

This project is part of my portfolio and shows how I approach **data engineering and analytics** using SQL Server.  
It covers everything from **building a warehouse** to **designing queries that generate real business insights**.  

I created this project not only to practice industry best practices, but also to demonstrate how raw data can be shaped into **meaningful, decision-ready information**.

## 🚀 What This Project Is About

The goal of this project is simple:  
**take messy source data → organize it into a clean warehouse → deliver insights that matter.**

**Main objectives:**
- Build a **SQL Server Data Warehouse** from multiple data sources  
- Apply **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** processes for data cleaning & integration  
- Create **analytics queries** that reveal customer, product, and sales insights  
- Document everything so both business and technical teams can understand it

## 🛠️ Data Engineering – Building the Warehouse

**Objective:**  
Design and implement a **data warehouse** that combines information from ERP and CRM systems.  

**Steps I followed:**
- Imported CSV files from two systems (**ERP & CRM**)  
- Cleaned and resolved data quality issues before loading  
- Integrated both datasets into a **single, user-friendly model**  
- Focused on the **latest dataset only** (keeping it simple — no historization for now)  
- Documented the data model for both **stakeholders and analysts**

## 📈 Data Analytics – Reporting & Insights

Once the warehouse was ready, I wrote SQL queries to uncover **business insights**:  
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Customer Behavior**: Who are the most valuable customers? Who is at risk of churn?  
- 📦 **Product Performance**: Which products drive the most revenue or underperform?  
- 💰 **Sales Trends**: How do sales evolve over time? What patterns can we spot?  

These outputs show how data can support **better business decisions** in a clear and actionable way.
